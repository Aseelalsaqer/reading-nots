* The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.
* Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1.
* Using the rotateX value allows you to rotate an element around the x axis, as if it were being bent in half horizontally.
