## How to run Linear regression in Python

- Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the sklearn.linear_model module which contains “methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables”.

Important functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:

- lm.fit() -> fits a linear model

- lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients

- lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.

- You can also explore the functions inside lm object by pressing lm.<tab>

Residual plots are a good way to visualize the errors in your data. If you have done a good job then your data should be randomly scattered around line zero. If you see structure in your data, that means your model is not capturing some thing. Maye be there is a interaction between 2 variables that you are not considering, or may be you are measuring time dependent data. If you get some structure in your data, you should go back to your model and check whether you are doing a good job with your parameters.

- I explored the boston data set and then renamed its column names.
- I explored the boston data set using .DESCR, my goal was to predict the housing prices using the given features.
- I used Scikit learn to fit linear regression to the entire data set and calculated the mean squared error.
- I made a train-test split and calculated the mean squared error for my training data and test data.
- I then plotted the residuals for my training and test datasets.
