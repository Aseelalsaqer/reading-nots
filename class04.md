# Links: 
* Links are created using the a element.
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
* You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
* You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

*****
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
* If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
* CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
1. Normal flow
2. Relative Positioning
3. Absolute positioning
* In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next
one.
* Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
* Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
* The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.
* The clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or righthand
sides of a box.
