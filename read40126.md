- Django was designed to make common Web-development tasks fast and easy.
- Although you can use Django without a database, it comes with an object-relational mapper in which you describe your database layout in Python code.
- Once your models are defined, Django can automatically create a professional, production ready administrative interface – a website that lets authenticated users add, change and delete objects.
- Django encourages beautiful URL design and doesn’t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp.
- You’ll need to avoid naming projects after built-in Python or Django components. In particular, this means you should avoid using names like django (which will conflict with Django itself) or test (which conflicts with a built-in Python package).
- The include() function allows referencing other URLconfs. Whenever Django encounters include(), it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.
- The path() function is passed four arguments, two required: route and view, and two optional: kwargs, and name. At this point, it’s worth reviewing what these arguments are for.
- path() argument: route¶
  route is a string that contains a URL pattern. When processing a request, Django starts at the first pattern in urlpatterns and makes its way down the list, comparing the requested URL against each pattern until it finds one that matches.
- path() argument: view¶
  When Django finds a matching pattern, it calls the specified view function with an HttpRequest object as the first argument and any “captured” values from the route as keyword arguments. We’ll give an example of this in a bit.
- path() argument: kwargs¶
  Arbitrary keyword arguments can be passed in a dictionary to the target view. We aren’t going to use this feature of Django in the tutorial.
- path() argument: name¶
  Naming your URL lets you refer to it unambiguously from elsewhere in Django, especially from within templates. This powerful feature allows you to make global changes to the URL patterns of your project while only touching a single file.
- Activating models¶
  That small bit of model code gives Django a lot of information. With it, Django is able to:

1. Create a database schema (CREATE TABLE statements) for this app.
2. Create a Python database-access API for accessing Question and Choice objects.

- request.POST is a dictionary-like object that lets you access submitted data by key name. In this case, request.POST['choice'] returns the ID of the selected choice, as a string. request.POST values are always strings.
- request.POST['choice'] will raise KeyError if choice wasn’t provided in POST data. The above code checks for KeyError and redisplays the question form with an error message if choice isn’t given.
- What are automated tests?¶
  Tests are routines that check the operation of your code.
