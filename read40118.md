# Encryption, decryption, and cracking

- Encrypting a message:
  The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.
- Decrypting a message:

### There are three ways to crack :

1.  frequency analysis
2.  known plaintext
3.  and brute force.

# Summry:

- Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
- Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
- Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.
