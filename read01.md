* A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only.
**Characteristics of Components**   
* Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

* Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

* Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

* Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

* Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

* Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.


# React 
is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces.
* “Props”  used for passing data from one component to another.

* data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)

*  props data is read-only.
