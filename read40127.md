## Models:
* are usually defined in an application's models.py file. They are implemented as subclasses of django.db.models.Model, and can include fields, methods and metadata.

* Common field types: 
1) CharField is used to define short-to-mid sized fixed-length strings. You must specify the max_length of the data to be stored.
2) TextField is used for large arbitrary-length strings. You may specify a max_length for the field, but this is used only when the field is displayed in forms (it is not enforced at the database level).
3) IntegerField is a field for storing integer (whole number) values, and for validating entered values as integers in forms.
4) DateField and DateTimeField are used for storing/representing dates and date/time information (as Python datetime.date in and datetime.datetime objects, respectively). These fields can additionally declare the (mutually exclusive) parameters auto_now=True (to set the field to the current date every time the model is saved), auto_now_add (to only set the date when the model is first created) , and default (to set a default date that can be overridden by the user).
5) EmailField is used to store and validate email addresses.
6) FileField and ImageField are used to upload files and images respectively (the ImageField adds additional validation that the uploaded file is an image). These have parameters to define how and where the uploaded files are stored.
7) AutoField is a special type of IntegerField that automatically increments. A primary key of this type is automatically added to your model if you donâ€™t explicitly specify one.
8) ForeignKey is used to specify a one-to-many relationship to another database model (e.g. a car has one manufacturer, but a manufacturer can make many cars). The "one" side of the relationship is the model that contains the "key" (models containing a "foreign key" referring to that "key", are on the "many" side of such a relationship).
9) ManyToManyField is used to specify a many-to-many relationship (e.g. a book can have several genres, and each genre can contain several books). In our library app we will use these very similarly to ForeignKeys, but they can be used in more complicated ways to describe the relationships between groups. These have the parameter on_delete to define what happens when the associated record is deleted (e.g. a value of models.SET_NULL would set the value to NULL).
* In every model you should define the standard Python class method __str__() to return a human-readable string for each object.
* get_absolute_url(), which returns a URL for displaying individual model records on the website
