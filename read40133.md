## JSON Web Token (JWT) :
- is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

- Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. 

#### where JSON Web Tokens are useful:
- Authorization
- Information Exchange
#### What is the JSON Web Token structure?
- Header: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
- Payload : The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. 
    - Registered claims
    - Public claims
    - Private claims
- Signature

#### benefits of JSON Web Tokens (JWT):
1) less verbose than XML
2) Security-wise
3) map directly to objects.

#### How to Use JWT Authentication with Django REST Framework:
- JWT stand for JSON Web Token and it is an authentication strategy used by client/server applications where the client is a Web application using JavaScript and some frontend framework like Angular, React or VueJS
- The JWT is acquired by exchanging an username + password for an access token and an refresh token.
- The access token is usually short-lived (expires in 5 min or so, can be customized though).
- The refresh token lives a little bit longer (expires in 24 hours, also customizable). It is comparable to an authentication session. After it expires, you need a full login with username + password again.

* If you want to run Django in production, be sure to use a production-ready web server like Nginx, and let your app be handled by a WSGI application server like
