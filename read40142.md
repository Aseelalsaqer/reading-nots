## Dunder Methods:
 They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__.
 ## Enriching a Simple Account Class
- Initialization of new objects
- Object representation
- Enable iteration
- Operator overloading (comparison)
- Operator overloading (addition)
- Method invocation
- Context manager support (with statement)

__repr__: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous.                   


__str__: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.
## Iterators
- for a simple while loop:

- It first prepared the repeater object for iteration by calling its __iter__ method. This returned the actual iterator object.
- After that, the loop repeatedly calls the iterator object’s __next__ method to retrieve values from it.

- RepeaterIterator class again? We needed it to host the __next__ method for fetching new values from the iterator. But it doesn’t really matter where __next__ is defined

## Generators
- Generator functions are syntactic sugar for writing objects that support the iterator protocol. Generators abstract away much of the boilerplate code needed when writing class-based iterators.
- The yield statement allows you to temporarily suspend execution of a generator function and to pass back values from it.
- Generators start raising StopIteration exceptions after control flow leaves the generator function by any means other than a yield statement.
