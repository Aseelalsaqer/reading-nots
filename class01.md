# HTML

The **HTML** code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets â€” these are called HTML **elements** . Elements are usually
made up of two **tags** : an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and
closing tags.

* HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages.

* Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.
