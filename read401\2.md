In Tests We Trust — TDD with Python  
Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think (and write!) tests first.  
A convention widely used is the AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.  
Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);  
Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.  
The cycle is made by three steps:

🆘Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn’t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)  
✅ Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)  
🔵 Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one (don’t be shy)  
What does the if **name** == “**main**”: do?
Every Python module has it’s **name** defined and if this is ‘**main**’, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.  
If you import this script as a module in another script, the **name** is set to the name of the script/module.  
Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.  
if **name** == “main”: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

What is Recursion?  
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.  
What is base condition in recursion?  
In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.
