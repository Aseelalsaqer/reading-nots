### Custom User Model                                                    
Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

1) update config/settings.py
2) create a new CustomUser model
3) create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm
4) update the admin

* In settings.py we'll add the accounts app and use the AUTH_USER_MODEL config to tell Django to use our new custom user model in place of the built-in User model. We'll call our custom user model CustomUser.

* Within INSTALLED_APPS add accounts at the bottom. Then at the bottom of the entire file, add the AUTH_USER_MODEL config.

* update accounts/models.py with a new User model which we'll call CustomUser.

* create a new file in the accounts app called forms.py.
*  update admin.py since the Admin is highly coupled to the default User model.
* run makemigrations and migrate for the first time to create a new database that uses the custom user model.
*  create a superuser
* updating settings.py to use a project-level templates directory.
* add html files .

###  DjangoX:
* which is an open-source Django starter framework that includes a custom user model, email/password by default instead of username/email/password, social authentication, and more.
