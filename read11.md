SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS);  NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

For properties: SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )

or the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.


SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.



What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage.


What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage
Give a real world example.

database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
