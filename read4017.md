**Global scope**: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

**Local scope**: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

### Python Scope vs Namespace:

Names at the top level of a module are stored in the module’s namespace. In other words, they’re stored in the module’s .**dict** attribute.

### Using the LEGB Rule for Python Scope:

The letters in LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in. Here’s a quick overview of what these terms mean:

- Local (or function) scope is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression.
- Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions.
- Global (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module.
- Built-in scope is a special Python scope that’s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session.

## Functions: The Local Scope:

The local scope or function scope is a Python scope created at function calls. Every time you call a function, you’re also creating a new local scope.

### Nested Functions: The Enclosing Scope:

Enclosing or nonlocal scope is observed when you nest functions inside other functions.

### Modules: The Global Scope

From the moment you start a Python program, you’re in the global Python scope. Internally, Python turns your program’s main script into a module called **main** to hold the main program’s execution.

### builtins: The Built-In Scope

The built-in scope is a special Python scope that’s implemented as a standard library module named builtins in Python 3.x. All of Python’s built-in objects live in this module.

### The global Statement

You already know that when you try to assign a value to a global name inside a function, you create a new local name in the function scope. To modify this behavior, you can use a global statement. With this statement, you can define a list of names that are going to be treated as global names.

### Class and Instance Attributes Scope

When you define a class, you’re creating a new local Python scope. The names assigned at the top level of the class live in this local scope. The names that you assigned inside a class statement don’t clash with names elsewhere. You can say that these names follow the LEGB rule, where the class block represents the L level.

### Using Scope Related Built-In Functions (Links to an external site.)

globals() is a built-in function that returns a reference to the current global scope or namespace dictionary. This dictionary always stores the names of the current module.

locals() This updates and returns a dictionary that holds a copy of the current state of the local Python scope or namespace.

vars() is a Python built-in function that returns the .**dict** attribute of a module, class, instance, or any other object which has a dictionary attribute. Remember that .**dict** is a special dictionary that Python uses to implement namespaces.

dir() using it without arguments to get the list of names in the current Python scope. If you call dir() with an argument, then the function attempts to return a list of valid attributes for that object
