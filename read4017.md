**Global scope**: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

**Local scope**: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

### Python Scope vs Namespace:

Names at the top level of a module are stored in the module’s namespace. In other words, they’re stored in the module’s .**dict** attribute.

### Using the LEGB Rule for Python Scope:

The letters in LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in. Here’s a quick overview of what these terms mean:

- Local (or function) scope is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression.
- Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions.
- Global (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module.
- Built-in scope is a special Python scope that’s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session.

## Functions: The Local Scope:

The local scope or function scope is a Python scope created at function calls. Every time you call a function, you’re also creating a new local scope.

### Nested Functions: The Enclosing Scope:

Enclosing or nonlocal scope is observed when you nest functions inside other functions.

### Modules: The Global Scope

From the moment you start a Python program, you’re in the global Python scope. Internally, Python turns your program’s main script into a module called **main** to hold the main program’s execution.

### builtins: The Built-In Scope

The built-in scope is a special Python scope that’s implemented as a standard library module named builtins in Python 3.x. All of Python’s built-in objects live in this module.

### The global Statement

You already know that when you try to assign a value to a global name inside a function, you create a new local name in the function scope. To modify this behavior, you can use a global statement. With this statement, you can define a list of names that are going to be treated as global names.

### Class and Instance Attributes Scope

When you define a class, you’re creating a new local Python scope. The names assigned at the top level of the class live in this local scope. The names that you assigned inside a class statement don’t clash with names elsewhere. You can say that these names follow the LEGB rule, where the class block represents the L level.
