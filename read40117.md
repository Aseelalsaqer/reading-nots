## Web Scraping

- Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort.

- The first thing that we need to do is to figure out where we can locate the links to the files we want to download inside the multiple levels of HTML tags.

- used libraries :

1. import requests
2. import urllib.request
3. import time
4. from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

- We use the method .findAll to locate all of our <a> tags.

1. soup.findAll('a')
