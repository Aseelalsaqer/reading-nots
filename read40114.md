- matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases.
- pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library
- Matplotlib comes with a set of default settings that allow customizing all kinds of properties. You can control the defaults of almost every property in matplotlib: figure size and dpi, line width, color and style, axes, axis and grid properties, text and font properties and so on. While matplotlib defaults are rather good in most cases, you may want to modify some properties for specific cases.
- Spines are the lines connecting the axis tick marks and noting the boundaries of the data area. They can be placed at arbitrary positions
- Axes are very similar to subplots but allow placement of plots at any location in the figure. So if we want to put a smaller plot inside a bigger one we do so with axes.

- Drip drop
  A very simple rain effect can be obtained by having small growing rings randomly positioned over a figure.
