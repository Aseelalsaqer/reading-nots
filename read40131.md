- Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development - desktop and cloud.
- With Docker we now longer have to mess around with virtual environments. We can faithfully reproduce a production environment locally. And Docker can be shared among team members so everyone is working on the same setup. 
- Virtual environments are used to isolate Python software packages locally.
- Docker Compose is an additional tool that is automatically included with Mac and Windows downloads of Docker.
- sudo pip install docker-compose after your Docker installation is complete.
- To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
- A good command to inspect Docker is docker info
-  An image is a snapshot in time of what a project contains. A container is a running instance of the image.
- we will create custom images and we do so using a Dockerfile. 
- We also will use docker-compose.yml files to run the containers.
## Django REST Framework is added just like any other third-party app. Make sure to quit the local server Control + c if it is still running.
- We covered a lot of material in this chapter so donâ€™t worry if things feel a little confusing right now. First we created a traditional Django Library website. Then we added Django REST Framework and were able to add an API endpoint with a minimal amount of code.
