3 Ways to develop my Growth Mindset:
- Acknowledge and embrace imperfections. \(Hiding from my weaknesses means I’ll never overcome them\).
- Try different learning tactics.
- Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning.” \(When I make a mistake or fall short of a goal, I haven’t failed; I’ve learned\).
