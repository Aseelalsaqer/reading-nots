### Dynamic Routes:
- if the page content depends on external data. We used getStaticProps to fetch required data to render the index page.
#### How to Statically Generate Pages with Dynamic Routes
If we want to create dynamic routes for blog posts:

1- We want each post to have the path /posts/<id>, where <id> is the name of the markdown file under the top-level posts directory.
2- Since we have ssg-ssr.md and pre-rendering.md, weâ€™d like the paths to be /posts/ssg-ssr and /posts/pre-rendering.
### Implement getStaticPaths:
<img src="read41.png"/>

### Render Markdown
- npm install remark remark-html
- import { remark } from 'remark'
- import html from 'remark-html'

<img src="read411.png"/>

### Development v.s. Production
- In development (npm run dev or yarn dev), getStaticPaths runs on every request.
- In production, getStaticPaths runs at build time.

## Deploying Your Next.js App
- The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform developed by the creators of Next.js.

1) Create a Vercel Account
2) Import your nextjs-blog repository

Vercel has many more features, such as:
- Custom Domains
- Environment Variables
