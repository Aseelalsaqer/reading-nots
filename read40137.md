## Variables and constant feature comparison:

## Variable declaration:
- ES6 introduced the let keyword, which allows for block-scoped variables which cannot be hoisted or redeclared.

## Constant declaration:
- ES6 introduced the const keyword, which cannot be redeclared or reassigned, but is not immutable.

## Arrow functions

## Multi-line strings
Using template literal syntax, a JavaScript string can span multiple lines without the need for concatenation.

## Implicit returns
The return keyword is implied and can be omitted if using arrow functions without a block body.
# React : 
Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
- You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2, user.firstName, or formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions.
- This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:
- Specifying Attributes with JSX
- JSX tags may contain children
- By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them.
- React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object
### Rendering Elements:
- An element describes what you want to see on the screen
- React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes
- React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
### Components and Props:
- Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.

##### Converting a Function to a Class
You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:

- Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
- Add a single empty method to it called render().
- Move the body of the function into the render() method.
- Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
- Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

-Replace this.props.date with this.state.date in the render() method 

### Handling Events
React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
