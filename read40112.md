Pandas
Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.
Customarily, we import as follows:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

1. Data representation. Pandas provide extremely streamlined forms of data representation.

2. Less writing and more work done.

3. An extensive set of features.

4. Efficiently handles large data.

5. Makes data flexible and customizable.

data and array (structured or homogeneous), Iterable, dict, or DataFrame Dict can contain Series, arrays, constants, dataclass or list-like objects. If data is a dict, column order follows insertion-order.

Changed in version 0.25.0: If data is a list of dicts, column order follows insertion-order.

DataFrame.to_numpy() gives a NumPy representation of the underlying data. Note that this can be an expensive operation when your DataFrame has columns with different data types, which comes down to a fundamental difference between pandas and NumPy: NumPy arrays have one dtype for the entire array, while pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column. When you call DataFrame.to_numpy(), pandas will find the NumPy dtype that can hold all of the dtypes in the DataFrame. This may end up being object, which requires casting every value to a Python object.

DataFrame.to_numpy() does not include the index or column labels in the output.

describe() shows a quick statistic summary of your data.

When selecting subsets of data, square brackets [] are used. Inside these brackets, you can use a single column/row label, a list of column/row labels, a slice of labels, a conditional expression or a colon.

Select specific rows and/or columns using loc when using the row and column names
Select specific rows and/or columns using iloc when using the positions in the table
You can assign new values to a selection based on loc/iloc.
Getting data in to pandas from many different file formats or data sources is supported by read\_\* functions.

Exporting data out of pandas is provided by different to\_\*methods.
