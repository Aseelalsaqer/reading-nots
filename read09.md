# Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

Pure Functions It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)

Pure functions benefits
The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything


immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
