## Hashtables:
What is a Hashtable?
* Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.
* Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
* Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
* Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
#### Why do we use them?
1) Hold unique values
2) Dictionary
3) Library

#### Creating a Hash:
1) Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
2) Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
3) Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
4) Insert into the array at that index.

* A collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array.
* If two keys ever ultimately resolved to the same index, then two calls to .Add(key, val) with different keys would overwrite each other.
#####  Hash maps do this to store values:

- accept a key
- calculate the hash of the key
- use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
- store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a - - - linked list

##### Hash maps do this to read value:

- accept a key
- calculate the hash of the key
- use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
- use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
- search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given

##### Internal Methods:
- Add()
- Find()
- Contains()
- GetHash()
