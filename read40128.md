# work with HTML Forms in Django,

- the easiest way to write forms to create, update, and delete model instances.

- An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.
- The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside <form>...</form> tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit".
- The field's **type** attribute defines what sort of widget will be displayed. The **name** and **id** of the field are used to identify the field in JavaScript/CSS/HTML, while **value** defines the initial value for the field when it is first displayed. The matching team **label** is specified using the label tag (see "Enter name" above), with a for field containing the id value of the associated input.The **submit** input will be displayed as a button (by default) that can be pressed by the user to upload the data .
- action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted.
- method: The HTTP method used to send the data: post or get.

## Django form handling process:

![](form_handling_-_standard.png)

- from django import forms
- After creating the form, we call render() to create the HTML page.
- Using {{ form.as_table }} as shown above, each field is rendered as a table row. You can also render each field as a list item (using {{ form.as_ul }} ) or as a paragraph (using {{ form.as_p }}).
