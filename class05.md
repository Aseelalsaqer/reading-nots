 # Images:
 To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:  
 **src** and **alt**    
 Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed.
 # Colors:
 There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
# Size :
Units of Type Size:   
* Pixels 
* Percentages
* Ems
Setting font size in pixels is the best way to ensure that the type appears at the size you intended (because percentages and ems are more likely to vary if a user has changed the default size of text in their browser).    
The default size of text in a web browser is 16 pixels.
