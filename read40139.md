### Assets, Metadata, and CSS:
- Next.js has built-in support for CSS and Sass.
#### Assets:
- Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level public directory. Files inside public can be referenced from the root of the application similar to pages.
- retrieve profile picture:
- Download your profile picture in .jpg format (or use this file).
- Create an images directory inside of the public directory.
- Save the picture as profile.jpg in the public/images directory.
- The image size can be around 400px by 400px.
- You may remove the unused SVG logo file directly under the public directory.
* add your profile picture <img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="Your Name" />
- next/image is an extension of the HTML <img> element
- Next.js also has support for Image Optimization by default. This allows for resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats like WebP when the browser supports it
- Instead of optimizing images at build time, Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them
#### Metadata:
- <Head> is used instead of the lowercase <head>. <Head> is a React Component that is built into Next.js. It allows you to modify the <head> of a page.

You can import the Head component from the next/head module.
import Head from 'next/head'
#### CSS Styling:
- styled-jsx. library: It’s a “CSS-in-JS” library — it lets you write CSS within a React component, and the CSS styles will be scoped (other components won’t be affected).
#### To use CSS Modules, the CSS file name must end with .module.css.
#### Global Styles: 
- You need to restart the development server when you add pages/_app.js. Press Ctrl + c to stop the server and run
- In Next.js, you can add global CSS files by importing them from pages/_app.js. You cannot import global CSS anywhere else.
- The reason that global CSS can't be imported outside of pages/_app.js is that global CSS affects all elements on the page.

#### Using classnames library to toggle classes:
- classnames is a simple library that lets you toggle class names easily. You can install it using npm install classnames or yarn add classnames.

## React Context:
- React context is an essential tool for every React developer to know. It lets us easily share state in our applications.
- React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props.
##### When should you use React context?
- React context is great when you are passing data that can be used in any component in your application.
- These types of data include:

    1) Theme data (like dark or light mode)
    2) User data (the currently authenticated user)
    3) Location-specific data (like user language or locale)

- React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling.

- Props drilling is a term to describe when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it.
### There are four steps to using React context:

- Create context using the createContext method.
- Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree.
- Put any value you like on your context provider using the value prop.
- Read that value within any component by using the context consumer.
- we can pass the entire context object to React.useContext() to consume context at the top of our component.
