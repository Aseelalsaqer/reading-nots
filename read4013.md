# Reading and Writing Files in Python

## a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer.

## Files are composed of three main parts:

- Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
- Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
- End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file

## The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. Itâ€™s broken up into three major parts:

- Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
- File Name: the actual name of the file
- Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

## Warning: You should always make sure that an open file is properly closed.

- 'r' Open for reading (default)
- 'w' Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first
- 'rb' or 'wb' Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)

## Reading and Writing Opened Files

- .read(size=-1) This reads from the file based on the number of size bytes. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire file is read.
- .readline(size=-1) This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read.
- .readlines() This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list.

## built-in libraries :

- wave: read and write WAV files (audio)
- aifc: read and write AIFF and AIFC files (audio)
- sunau: read and write Sun AU files
- tarfile: read and write tar archive files
- zipfile: work with ZIP archives
- configparser: easily create and parse configuration files
- xml.etree.ElementTree: create or read XML based files
- msilib: read and write Microsoft Installer files
- plistlib: generate and parse Mac OS X .plist files

# Exceptions versus Syntax Errors:

- Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement.
