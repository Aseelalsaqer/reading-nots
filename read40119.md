## Regular Expression

- Regular Expressions :
  are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not
- The re library in Python provides several functions that make it a skill worth mastering:

1. The match() function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern.
2. With the search function, you scan through the given string/sequence, looking for the first location where the regular expression produces a match.
3. The group function returns the string matched by the re. You will see both these functions in more detail later.
4. compile(pattern, flags=0)
5. findall(pattern, string, flags=0)
6. finditer(string, [position, end_position])
7. start() - Returns the starting index of the match.
8. end() - Returns the index where the match ends.
9. span() - Return a tuple containing the (start, end) positions of the match.
   **Special characters**are characters that do not match themselves as seen but have a special meaning when used in a regular expression.

- Regular expressions are handled as strings by Python. However, with compile(), you can computer a regular expression pattern into a regular expression object. When you need to use an expression several times in a single program, using compile() to save the resulting regular expression object for reuse is more efficient than saving it as a string. This is because the compiled versions of the most recent patterns passed to compile() and the module-level matching functions are cached.
