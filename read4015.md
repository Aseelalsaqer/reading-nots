##### Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

- Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity)
  The amount of time a function needs to complete.

- Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity)
  The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.

##### 4 Key Areas for analysis:

- Input Size
- Units of Measurement
- Orders of Growth
- Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

### We will use the letter n to refer to the Input Size value.

The higher this number, the more likely there will be an increase to Running Time and Memory Space.

- Always be aware that Space Complexity and Time Complexity are measured differently and should be analyzed separately.

### Orders of Growth

We can describe overall efficiency by using the input size n and measuring the overall Units of Space and Time required for the given input size n. As the value of n grows, the Order of Growth represents the increase in Running Time or Memory Space.

## Big O: The worst case analysis of algorithm efficiency.

## Running Time: The amount of time required for an algorithm to complete.

## Memory Space: The amount of memory resources required for an algorithm to complete.

## Input Size: Represented by the variable n, the total size of values used as parameters in an algorithm.

## Big Omega: The best case analysis of algorithm efficiency.

## Big Theta: The typical or random case used for analysis of algorithm efficiency

# What is a Linked List:

- A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.  
Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.  
Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.  
Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.  
Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.  
Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.  
Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

### Traversal Big O

The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n). This is because, at its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list.

The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1). This is because there is no additional space being used than what is already given to us with the linked list input.

# When making your Node class, consider requiring a value to be passed in to require that each node has a value.
