# Classes and Objects

Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

- You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined)

# Recursive Functions in Python

- A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:

- Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context
- Keep the state in global scope

### A data structure is recursive if it can be deﬁned in terms of a smaller version of itself. A list is an example of a recursive data structure.
