# JavaScript:
**JavaScript** is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.
* The place where we'll be adding all our code is inside the <script> element at the bottom of the HTML.
## Adding variables to store our data.
Variables could be (numbers, letters,boolean).
* Alert is one of JS functions .
* JavaScript operators allow us to perform tests, do math, join strings together, and other such things using (+,-,*)

### Errors:
1. **Syntax errors** : These are spelling errors.
2. **Logic errors** : These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be.

* **Concatenate** is a   fancy programming word that means "join together". Joining together strings in JavaScript uses the plus (+) operator.
#### Basic setup:


1. Create a new file called **main.js** , in the same directory as your **index.html** file.
2. Apply the external JavaScript file to your HTML by inserting a **<script>** element into your HTML referencing **main.js** . Put it just before the closing **</body> tag.
