# GIT
Git is a **distributed version control** system that helps developers collaborate on projects of any scale.
**What is a Distributed Version Control System?**
* A distributed version control system is a system that helps you keep track of changes you've made to files in your project.
* This change history lives on your local machine and lets you revert to a previous version of your project with ease in case something goes wrong.
* Git makes collaboration easy. Everyone on the team can keep a full backup of the repositories they're working on on their local machine. Then, using an external server like  GitHub  they can safely store the repository in a single place.\
This way, different members of the team can copy it locally and everyone has a clear overview of all changes made by the whole team.
**Some of GIT commands:**
1. git add
2. git commit -m
3. git push\pul
