### JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

- Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.

- Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.

- Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.

- Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.

### The extension developer API is evolving, and we also are currently iterating on UI/UX improvements. We appreciate feedback on our GitHub issues page as we evolve towards a stable extension development API.

- JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook. Throughout this transition, the same notebook document format will be supported by both the classic Notebook and JupyterLab.

## **NumPy** Tutorial: Data Analysis with Python

Don’t miss our FREE NumPy cheat sheet at the bottom of this post

NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem

- The first element of each row is the fixed acidity, the second is the volatile acidity, and so on. We can find the average quality of the wines. The below code will:

- Extract the last element from each row after the header row.
- Convert each extracted element to a float.
- Assign all the extracted elements to the list qualities.
- Divide the sum of all the elements in qualities by the total number of elements in qualities to the get the mean.

### Creating A NumPy Array

- Import the numpy package.
- Pass the list of lists wines into the array function, which converts it into a NumPy array.
- Exclude the header row with list slicing.
- Specify the keyword argument dtype to make sure each element is converted to a float. We’ll dive more into what the dtype is later on.

### Using NumPy To Read In Files

- Use the genfromtxt function to read in the winequality-red.csv file.
- Specify the keyword argument delimiter=";" so that the fields are parsed properly.
- Specify the keyword argument skip_header=1 so that the header row is skipped.

## NumPy Array Operations

- If you do any of the basic mathematical operations (/, \*, -, +, ^) with an array and a value, it will apply the operation to each of the elements in the array.
