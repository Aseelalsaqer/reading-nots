### Conditional Rendering:
- In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.
- Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
###### Element Variables
- You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn’t change. 
- While declaring a variable and using an if statement is a fine way to conditionally render a component, sometimes you might want to use a shorter syntax
###### Inline If with Logical && Operator
- You may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical && operator
- It works because in JavaScript, true && expression always evaluates to expression, and false && expression always evaluates to false.
###### Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator
- Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript conditional operator condition ? true : false.
#### Preventing Component from Rendering
- component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return null instead of its render output.
### Lists and Keys:
- we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it
###### Rendering Multiple Components
- You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.

-  we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a <li> element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems

- Usually you would render lists inside a component.
##### Keys
- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
-  you extract a ListItem component, you should keep the key on the <ListItem /> elements in the array rather than on the <li> element in the ListItem itself.
- Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Sibl
#### Forms:
- HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.
- In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().
###### The textarea Tag
- In HTML, a <textarea> element defines its text by its children
###### The select Tag:
- In HTML,  < select > creates a drop-down list

##### The file input Tag
- In HTML, an <input type="file"> lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by JavaScript via the File API.
#### Controlled Input Null Value
- Specifying the value prop on a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input unless you desire so. If you’ve specified a value but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set value to undefined or null.
### Composition vs Inheritance
###### Containment
- Some components don’t know their children ahead of time. This is especially common for components like Sidebar or Dialog that represent generic “boxes”
- Anything inside the <FancyBorder> JSX tag gets passed into the FancyBorder component as a children prop. Since FancyBorder renders {props.children} inside a <div>, the passed elements appear in the final output.
- React elements like <Contacts /> and <Chat /> are just objects, so you can pass them as props like any other data. This approach may remind you of “slots” in other libraries but there are no limitations on what you can pass as props in React.
###### Inheritance:
- At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven’t found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.
##### Thinking in React:
- ###### Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
    - FilterableProductTable (orange): contains the entirety of the example
    - SearchBar (blue): receives all user input
    - ProductTable (green): displays and filters the data collection based on user input
    - ProductCategoryRow (turquoise): displays a heading for each category
    - ProductRow (red): displays a row for each product
- ##### Step 2: Build A Static Version in React
- ##### Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
- ##### Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live
- ##### Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow
