# Building Blocks:
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
* Block-level elements start on a new line.
* Inline elements flow in between surrounding text.
* If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
## Three ways tp Control the Position of Elements:
1. normal flow
2. relative positioning
3. Absolute positioning

**You can include multiple CSS files in one page.**
