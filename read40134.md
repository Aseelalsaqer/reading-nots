## Django Settings:
- Different environments:
local, dev, ci, qa, staging, production
- Each environment can have its own specific settings

- Sensitive data. You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project. On top of this there can be DB passwords and tokens for third-party APIs like Amazon or Twitter. This data cannot be stored in VCS.
- 12 Factors is a collection of recommendations on how to build distributed web-apps that will be easy to deploy and scale in the Cloud. It was created by Heroku, a well-known Cloud hosting provider:
- Codebase
- Dependencies
- Config
- Backing services
- Build, release, run
- Processes
- Port binding
- Concurrency
- Disposability
- Dev/prod parity
- Logs
- Admin processes
## Naming Conventions
rules for (project) settings:
1) Give meaningful names to your settings.
2) Always use the prefix with the project name for your custom (project) settings.
3) Write descriptions for your settings in comments.

## Django Settings: Best practices:
- Keep settings in environment variables.
- Write default values for production configuration (excluding secret keys and tokens).
- Don’t hardcode sensitive settings, and don’t put them in VCS.
- Split settings into groups: Django, third-party, project.
- Follow naming conventions for custom (project) settings.

## SSH:
SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet. 
- for Windows, you will need to utilize an SSH client to open SSH connections. The most popular SSH client is PuTTY

- There are three different encryption technologies used by SSH:

- Symmetrical encryption
- Asymmetrical encryption
- Hashing.

## Symmetric Encryption:
- Symmetric encryption is a form of encryption where a secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and the host
## Asymmetric Encryption : 
- Unlike symmetrical encryption, asymmetrical encryption uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption. These two keys are known as the public key and the private key. Together, both these keys form a public-private key pair.
## Hashing:
- One-way hashing is another form of cryptography used in Secure Shell Connections. One-way-hash functions differ from the above two forms of encryption in the sense that they are never meant to be decrypted. They generate a unique value of a fixed length for each input that shows no clear trend which can exploited. This makes them practically impossible to reverse.

- The way SSH works is by making use of a client-server model to allow for authentication of two remote systems and encryption of the data that passes between them.

## Authenticating the User:
- The final stage before the user is granted access to the server is authenticating his/her credentials. For this, most SSH users use a password. The user is asked to enter the username, followed by the password. These credentials securely pass through the symmetrically encrypted tunnel, so there is no chance of them being captured by a third party.
